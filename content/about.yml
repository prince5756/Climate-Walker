title: About Me
description: I am a visionary person from the very small village of Bhavnagar, Gujarat, India. I was a brilliant student throughout my school years, then I began my career by studying chartered accountancy ( C.A. ) in Surat, but soon I realized that I was more interested in the tourism sector, so I decided to study tour and travel management.

  Hi, I'm **Jaydip Lakhankiya**, a solo traveler from Gujarat. I completed my management course, and then I became a certied trekking instructor and joined India’s largest trekking organization, “Invincible NGO, as a senior trekking instructor and volunteer.

  During the COVID-19 pandemic, I realised that I had theoretical knowledge about traveling, but I wanted to gain practical knowledge about traveling, so I started my solo backpacking journey to see real and rural India. I traveled all over India by walking and hitchhiking for 182 days with almost no money

  ### Life turning point

  The India trip totally changed me as a person, I found a deeper meaning in life. After this trip, I started working with NGOs for different causes and for the betterment of our planet. I started Gujarat’s first certied kayaking organization for the development of the tourism sector

  I pursued some more courses related to this eld, and because of my passion for traveling, I got a chance to study more about travel in Malta, Europe.


  ### Global Youth Leadership

  So many times I got the chance to inspire people in India and in Europe also through my journey. In 2025, I was selected in a youth festival in Greece as a guest and volunteer to inspire their youth and students.

  During my whole journey, I always connected with nature. In India, I worked with NGOs for nature, and in Europe also, I worked for nature. I got the chance to study more about nature and climate change, and as a passionate nature lover, I believes that it’s my responsibility to take every possible step to save nature and the earth, and this walking journey is the next step for Mother Earth.
