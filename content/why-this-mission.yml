title: Why this mission
description: "I choose to walk rather then taking transport because in a world driven by speed, emissions, and consumption, I chose to slow down — to walk — as a symbol of what we urgently need: A shift from carbon emitting to carbon neutral."

  Climate change is not just about the environment. It’s about people—our health, our food, our homes, our future.. It affects everyone, everywhere, it’s a human crisis. It’s already harming millions of people around the world.
  * People are dying from extreme heat.
  * Farmers are losing their crops because of droughts and oods.
  * Families are being forced from their homes by rising seas and wildres.
  * Diseases are spreading faster in a warmer world.
  * And mental health is breaking down as people live in fear of what’s coming.

  Climate change is not just hurting people — it’s also breaking the natural balance that all life depends on.
  * Forests are burning, Coral reefs are dying from ocean heat and acidication.
  * Wetlands, rivers, glaciers, and mountains are changing faster than specie can adapt.
  * Climate change forces animals to migrate or die.
  * Species are going extinct quietly, one by one.
  * Food chains are being disrupted, leading to species starvation.
  * the rhythm of nature is breaking down — and with it, the survival of life.
  * Trees and oceans used to absorb CO₂, helping balance the atmosphere, now with rising temperatures and damage, they are becoming less effective. In some places, forests are releasing carbon through res, not storing it.
