I completed my management course, and then I became a certied trekking instructor and joined India’s largest trekking organization, “Invincible NGO, as a senior trekking instructor and volunteer.\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, I realised that I had theoretical knowledge about traveling, but I wanted to gain practical knowledge about traveling, so I started my solo backpacking journey to see real and rural India. I traveled all over India by walking and hitchhiking for 182 days with almost no money\n\n### Life turning point\n\nThe India trip totally changed me as a person, I found a deeper meaning in life. After this trip, I started working with NGOs for different causes and for the betterment of our planet. I started Gujarat’s first certied kayaking organization for the development of the tourism sector\n\nI pursued some more courses related to this eld, and because of my passion for traveling, I got a chance to study more about travel in Malta, Europe.\n\n\n### Global Youth Leadership\n\nSo many times I got the chance to inspire people in India and in Europe also through my journey.
